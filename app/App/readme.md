# App controller notebook.
This book would explain important lines, folders, files, classes, functions we've added to this Controller.

## Folder structure
Here we would explain how the folders are designed and what they would offer to increase in productivity and creativity.

### Models
Contains models for this controller and it's view models.

### Packages
Contains extra classes, functions that should be used by this controller. They can extended usability to other controllers outside this scope.

### Static
Contains App.css and App.js files and it's only avaliable for App views. This directory allows us define custom styles and scripts for our views that can also be extended by other controllers at run time.

### Custom
Contains this controller header and footer files. This can be activated by including '@setdefault;' anywhere in the header or footer file.

### Views
Contains all views for our controller.

### Partials
Contains partials for this controller that would enable us create resuable components in '.html|.md' file formats. This feature makes our views clean by not repeating ourselves, dynamic and scalable when the design requirements changes.

### Providers
Contains view providers. This providers would listen for when the view will load and when the view will enter. This gives us so much power and control with view management. And they can also contain methods that can be called in a controller, model or in a view.
